enVacances
==========

Overview
--------
enVacances is a simple app designed to help friends make accounts after a short holiday trip. It's a work in progress and is not usable as of today. Not unstable, but it doesn't bring much in terms of features.

Build instructions
------------------
Currently built with the latest (v. 3.2.4) Xcode version on Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard.
There are no dependencies at all, stock OS and Xcode should do.
